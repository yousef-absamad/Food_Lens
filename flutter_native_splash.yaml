flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.

  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below.

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.

  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  #image: assets/splash.png

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file. It is supported for Android, iOS and the Web.  For Android 12,
  # see the Android 12 section below.

  # branding_bottom_padding: 24

  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above.  If there is no parameter above, the app will use the light mode values.
  # If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or background_image_dark must be specified.  
  # color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be set.
  #color_dark: "#042a49"

  # From Android 12 onwards, the splash screen is handled differently than in previous versions.
  # Please visit https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen
  # Following are specific parameters for Android 12+.
  android_12:   
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
    # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
    # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
    # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 640 pixels in diameter.
    # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 768 pixels in diameter.  To fit a 1152x1152 image within a circle with a 768 diameter, simply 
    # ensure that the most important design elements of your image are placed within a circular area
    # with a 768 diameter at the center of the 1152x1152 canvas.
